RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) is a storage technology that combines multiple disk drives into a single logical unit to improve performance, reliability, or both. It's crucial for database systems requiring high availability and performance.

## Introduction to RAID

RAID was introduced to address the limitations of single disk drives and provide solutions for:
- **Performance improvement** through parallelism
- **Fault tolerance** through redundancy
- **Cost-effectiveness** compared to expensive high-capacity drives

### Key Concepts

#### Striping
Data is divided into blocks and distributed across multiple drives.

**Block Size Formula:**
If total data size is $D$ and number of drives is $n$:
$$Block\\_Size = \\frac{D}{n}$$

#### Mirroring
Identical copies of data are stored on multiple drives.

#### Parity
Error-correcting information calculated from data blocks.

**Parity Calculation (XOR):**
For drives $D_1, D_2, ..., D_n$:
$$Parity = D_1 ⊕ D_2 ⊕ ... ⊕ D_n$$

## RAID Levels

### RAID 0 (Striping)

**Configuration:**
- Minimum 2 drives
- No redundancy
- Data striped across all drives

**Advantages:**
- Maximum performance
- 100% storage utilization
- Linear performance scaling

**Disadvantages:**
- No fault tolerance
- Single drive failure = total data loss

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Read Performance:** $n × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Write Performance:** $n × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Capacity:** $n × \\text{drive capacity}$

\`\`\`
Drive 1: [A1][A3][A5][A7]
Drive 2: [A2][A4][A6][A8]
\`\`\`

### RAID 1 (Mirroring)

**Configuration:**
- Minimum 2 drives
- Data mirrored across drives
- 50% storage efficiency

**Advantages:**
- High fault tolerance
- Fast read performance
- Simple recovery

**Disadvantages:**
- 50% storage utilization
- Write performance penalty

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Read Performance:** $n × \\text{single drive speed}$ (parallel reads)
- **Write Performance:** $\\text{single drive speed}$ (must write to all mirrors)
- **Capacity:** $\\frac{n × \\text{drive capacity}}{2}$

\`\`\`
Drive 1: [A1][A2][A3][A4]
Drive 2: [A1][A2][A3][A4] (mirror)
\`\`\`

### RAID 2 (Bit-level Striping with Hamming Code)

**Configuration:**
- Bit-level striping
- Hamming code for error correction
- Rarely used in practice

**Error Detection:**
Uses Hamming distance for error correction:
$$Hamming\\_Distance = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |bit_i^{(1)} - bit_i^{(2)}|$$

### RAID 3 (Byte-level Striping with Parity)

**Configuration:**
- Byte-level striping
- Dedicated parity drive
- Synchronous operation

**Parity Calculation:**
For data bytes $D_1, D_2, ..., D_n$:
$$Parity\\_Byte = D_1 ⊕ D_2 ⊕ ... ⊕ D_n$$

### RAID 4 (Block-level Striping with Parity)

**Configuration:**
- Block-level striping
- Dedicated parity drive
- Independent drive operation

**Bottleneck Analysis:**
Parity drive becomes bottleneck for writes:
$$Write\\_Throughput = \\min(Data\\_Drives\\_Speed, Parity\\_Drive\\_Speed)$$

### RAID 5 (Block-level Striping with Distributed Parity)

**Configuration:**
- Minimum 3 drives
- Block-level striping
- Parity distributed across all drives

**Advantages:**
- Good read performance
- Fault tolerance (1 drive failure)
- No single point of failure

**Disadvantages:**
- Write penalty (read-modify-write)
- Complex recovery process

**Performance Analysis:**
- **Read Performance:** $(n-1) × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Write Performance:** $\\frac{n-1}{4} × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Capacity:** $(n-1) × \\text{drive capacity}$

**Write Penalty:**
For each write operation:
1. Read old data and old parity
2. Calculate new parity
3. Write new data and new parity

Total I/O operations: 4 (2 reads + 2 writes)

\`\`\`
Drive 1: [A1][A4][A7][P3]
Drive 2: [A2][A5][P2][A10]
Drive 3: [A3][P1][A8][A11]
Drive 4: [P0][A6][A9][A12]
\`\`\`

### RAID 6 (Block-level Striping with Double Parity)

**Configuration:**
- Minimum 4 drives
- Two parity blocks per stripe
- Can survive 2 drive failures

**Dual Parity Calculation:**
- **P Parity:** Standard XOR parity
- **Q Parity:** Reed-Solomon code parity

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Uses Galois Field arithmetic GF(2^8):
$$Q = g^0 × D_0 ⊕ g^1 × D_1 ⊕ ... ⊕ g^{n-1} × D_{n-1}$$

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Read Performance:** $(n-2) × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Write Performance:** $\\frac{n-2}{6} × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Capacity:** $(n-2) × \\text{drive capacity}$

### RAID 10 (1+0): Striped Mirrors

**Configuration:**
- Minimum 4 drives
- Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0
- Mirror first, then stripe

**Advantages:**
- High performance
- High fault tolerance
- Fast recovery

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Read Performance:** $n × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Write Performance:** $\\frac{n}{2} × \\text{single drive speed}$
- **Capacity:** $\\frac{n × \\text{drive capacity}}{2}$

\`\`\`
Mirror Set 1: Drive 1 & 2
Mirror Set 2: Drive 3 & 4
Stripe across mirror sets

\`\`\`python
# Example: Software RAID configuration
import os

class SoftwareRAID:
    def __init__(self, drives, raid_level):
        self.drives = drives
        self.raid_level = raid_level
        self.stripe_size = 64 * 1024  # 64KB
    
    def write_data(self, data, address):
        if self.raid_level == 0:
            return self.raid0_write(data, address)
        elif self.raid_level == 1:
            return self.raid1_write(data, address)
        elif self.raid_level == 5:
            return self.raid5_write(data, address)
    
    def raid5_write(self, data, address):
        stripe_num = address // self.stripe_size
        drive_num = stripe_num % (len(self.drives) - 1)
        parity_drive = stripe_num % len(self.drives)
        
        # Calculate parity
        parity = self.calculate_parity(data, stripe_num)
        
        # Write data and parity
        self.drives[drive_num].write(data, address)
        self.drives[parity_drive].write(parity, address)
\`\`\`

## Performance Analysis

### Throughput Calculations

**RAID 0:**
$$Throughput = n × Single\\_Drive\\_Throughput$$

**RAID 1:**
$$Read\\_Throughput = n × Single\\_Drive\\_Throughput$$
$$Write\\_Throughput = Single\\_Drive\\_Throughput$$

**RAID 5:**
$$Read\\_Throughput = (n-1) × Single\\_Drive\\_Throughput$$
$$Write\\_Throughput = \\frac{(n-1) × Single\\_Drive\\_Throughput}{4}$$

### Reliability Calculations

**Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):**

**RAID 0:**
$$MTBF_{RAID0} = \\frac{MTBF_{single}}{n}$$

**RAID 1:**
$$MTBF_{RAID1} = \\frac{MTBF_{single}^2}{n × MTTR}$$

**RAID 5:**
$$MTBF_{RAID5} = \\frac{MTBF_{single}^2}{n × (n-1) × MTTR}$$

Where MTTR is Mean Time To Repair.

## Database-Specific Considerations

### Transaction Log Placement

**Best Practices:**
- Place transaction logs on RAID 1
- Separate from data files
- Use dedicated drives for logs

**Reasoning:**
Transaction logs are sequential write-intensive:
$$Log\\_Write\\_Pattern = Sequential\\_Writes + Synchronous\\_I/O$$

### Data File Placement

**Recommendations:**
- Use RAID 5 or RAID 10 for data files
- Consider workload characteristics
- Balance performance and cost

### Backup Strategy

**RAID is not backup:**
- Hardware failures ✓
- Data corruption ✗
- Accidental deletion ✗
- Malicious attacks ✗

## Advanced RAID Concepts

### Hot Spares

Standby drives that automatically replace failed drives.

**Rebuild Time:**
$$Rebuild\\_Time = \\frac{Drive\\_Capacity}{Rebuild\\_Speed}$$

**Vulnerability Window:**
Time when array is vulnerable to second failure:
$$Vulnerability = Rebuild\\_Time × Failure\\_Rate$$

### RAID Levels Comparison

| RAID Level | Min Drives | Fault Tolerance | Read Performance | Write Performance | Capacity |
|------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| RAID 0 | 2 | None | Excellent | Excellent | 100% |
| RAID 1 | 2 | 1 drive | Excellent | Good | 50% |
| RAID 5 | 3 | 1 drive | Very Good | Fair | (n-1)/n |
| RAID 6 | 4 | 2 drives | Very Good | Poor | (n-2)/n |
| RAID 10 | 4 | Multiple | Excellent | Very Good | 50% |

### Nested RAID Levels

**RAID 50:** RAID 5 + RAID 0
**RAID 60:** RAID 6 + RAID 0
**RAID 01:** RAID 0 + RAID 1

**Performance Formula for RAID 50:**
$$Throughput = Number\\_of\\_RAID5\\_Sets × RAID5\\_Throughput$$

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring

**Key Metrics:**
- Drive temperature
- Error rates
- Performance degradation
- Rebuild progress

**SMART Attributes:**
- Reallocated Sector Count
- Power-On Hours
- Temperature
- Seek Error Rate

### Proactive Maintenance

**Predictive Failure Analysis:**
$$Failure\\_Probability = f(SMART\\_Attributes, Age, Usage\\_Pattern)$$

**Scheduled Operations:**
- Consistency checks
- Performance monitoring
- Firmware updates
- Drive replacement
