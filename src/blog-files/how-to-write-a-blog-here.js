## Introduction

Mathematical formulas are essential in computer science. Let's explore some key concepts.

### Inline Math

The famous equation $E = mc^2$ revolutionized physics. In computer science, we often use the Big O notation like $O(n^2)$ to describe time complexity.

### Block Math

The quadratic formula is:

$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

### Summation

The sum of first n natural numbers:

$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

## Code Example

Here's a Python implementation:

\`\`\`python
def quadratic_formula(a, b, c):
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    if discriminant < 0:
        return "No real solutions"
    elif discriminant == 0:
        return -b / (2*a)
    else:
        import math
        sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
        x1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)
        x2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)
        return x1, x2
\`\`\`

## Matrix Operations

A 2x2 matrix multiplication:

$\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ae+bg & af+bh \\\\ ce+dg & cf+dh \\end{pmatrix}$

> This is important for computer graphics and machine learning!

## Table Example

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Binary Search | $O(\\log n)$ | $O(1)$ |
| Merge Sort | $O(n \\log n)$ | $O(n)$ |
| Quick Sort | $O(n^2)$ worst case | $O(\\log n)$ |
